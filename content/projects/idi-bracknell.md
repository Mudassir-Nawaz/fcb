I recently hired First Choice Builder to restore my patio and driveway, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. They undertook a comprehensive project that included laying a concrete layer, paving the patio with porcelain slabs, building a patio wall, and laying the driveway.From start to finish, the team at First Choice Builder demonstrated exceptional professionalism. They were punctual and adhered to the agreed-upon timeline, completing all the work on time. The quality of their work is outstanding; every aspect of the project was handled with great attention to detail and precision.The new patio and driveway look fantastic and have significantly enhanced the overall appearance and functionality of my outdoor space. I highly recommend First Choice Builder to anyone in need of high-quality restoration or construction services. Their dedication to delivering excellent results and maintaining a high standard of professionalism sets them apart from the rest.
