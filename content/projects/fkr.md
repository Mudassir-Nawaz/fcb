This project involved the complete transformation of an outdated kitchen into a sleek and modern culinary space. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the renovation process:

1. Initial State and Demolition
The original kitchen featured dated fixtures, limited storage, and a lack of efficient layout functionality.
A full strip-out was conducted, including removal of old cabinets, appliances, and flooring. The space was prepared for a contemporary redesign.

2. Structural Changes
An open-plan layout was enhanced by maintaining the archway structure, creating a bright and seamless flow between the kitchen and adjacent spaces.
Walls and ceilings were replastered to provide a clean base for painting and new installations.

3. Cabinetry and Storage
Modern handleless cabinets with a high-gloss finish were installed, providing a sleek and minimalistic look while maximizing storage.
Both wall-mounted and base units were carefully positioned to ensure functionality and aesthetics.

4. Worktops and Backsplash
Durable and stylish marble-effect worktops were added to complement the overall neutral color palette.
A matching marble-effect backsplash creates a cohesive and polished appearance.

5. Appliances and Utilities
Integrated appliances, including an oven, gas hob, and dishwasher, were installed for a clean and uncluttered look.
A new sink was positioned under the window for natural lighting, paired with modern fixtures.

6. Flooring and Lighting
Dark-toned laminate flooring was chosen to contrast elegantly with the lighter cabinetry.
Spotlights and a pendant light over the sink area were installed to enhance illumination and ambiance.

7. Final Touches
Thoughtful decorations, such as plants and patterned blinds, add personality and warmth to the space.
The finished kitchen is now a functional and aesthetically pleasing hub, perfect for modern living and entertaining.
