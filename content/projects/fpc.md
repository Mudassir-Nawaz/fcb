This project involved the complete design and construction of a modern front porch. The transformation showcases a blend of functionality and aesthetics while maintaining harmony with the existing brickwork of the property.

**Initial Work**
The project began with the removal of the existing porch area, preparing the foundation for a structurally sound and visually appealing entrance. This included clearing old pavers and ensuring a stable base for the new construction.

**Structural Build**
A sturdy brick framework was meticulously built to match the original house’s design. This seamless integration of materials reflects attention to detail, blending old and new elements perfectly. The porch features a classic pitched roof with durable tiles for weather resistance.

**Finishing Touches**
The entrance door was upgraded to a bold and elegant navy blue, flanked by frosted glass panels, allowing natural light while maintaining privacy.
The internal area was completed with polished marble-effect tiles, creating a clean and modern entryway that complements the home’s interior.
Decorative elements, such as a traditional outdoor lamp and house number plaque, add character and charm.

**Landscaping**
The surrounding area was re-paved to align with the new design, ensuring smooth access and enhancing curb appeal. Additional greenery and flowerpots further beautify the entry.
