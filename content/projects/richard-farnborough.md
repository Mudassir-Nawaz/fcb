Jon and his team did outstanding work. Even though there was a delay, they were patient with us. They are the best choice to rebuild our garden wall and fence. Theyâ€™re professionals, hardworking responding promptly to all our queries, reliable, honest and trustworthy. Their attention to detail is exceptional. They completed the work within our budget and time frame. The building site was tidied up and spotless. Our wall looks splendid and has had compliments from passers-by and neighbours as well as recommendations! We will definitely use them again for our other projects. If you are looking for a skilled bricklayer, l highly recommend First Choice. Thank you.
