### Overview
Enjoy a green, low-maintenance lawn year-round with our top-of-the-line artificial turf. Perfect for areas with heavy foot traffic or challenging soil conditions, Astroturf delivers lasting beauty without the need for regular mowing or watering.

### Key Features
- **Realistic Appearance:** Advanced turf technology replicates the texture and colour variations of natural grass.
- **Durability & Drainage:** The sub-base is engineered for efficient water runoff, preventing puddles and reducing mud.
- **Child & Pet Friendly:** Soft, non-toxic materials provide a safe play area and are easy to clean up after pets.

### Project Stages
- **Consultation & Site Prep:** We measure the area, remove existing grass, and level the ground.
- **Base Construction:** A crushed stone or aggregate sub-base is installed and compacted thoroughly.
- **Turf Fitting:** We secure seams and edges to prevent wrinkling, ensuring a neat, uniform finish.
- **Infill & Grooming:** Silica sand or rubber infill can be brushed into the turf (depending on product specs) for added stability and natural feel.

### Warranty & Guarantees
- **Long-Term Product Warranty:** Premium artificial grass often includes coverage of 5â€“10 years or more.
- **Installation Guarantee:** We cover any workmanship-related issues that may arise post-install.
- **Maintenance Tips:** With occasional brushing and rinsing, your Astroturf will stay pristine for years.
