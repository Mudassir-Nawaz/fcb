### Overview
Preserve and restore the structural integrity of brick or stonework by renewing damaged or weather-worn mortar joints. Repointing extends the life of your walls or paving while refreshing its overall appearance.

### Key Features
- **Detailed Inspection:** We carefully evaluate mortar condition, matching new mortar type and colour to the existing structure.
- **Precision Removal:** Old, crumbling joints are gently removed without damaging surrounding masonry.
- **Professional Application:** Fresh mortar is packed into joints uniformly, creating a water-resistant seal.

### Project Stages
- **Assessment & Sample Matching:** Mortar samples are tested for composition and color to ensure a seamless blend.
- **Cleaning & Preparation:** Surfaces are cleaned to remove dirt or debris, and loose mortar is painstakingly extracted.
- **Repointing & Curing:** Mortar is applied in layers and allowed to cure gradually, minimizing shrinkage or cracking.
- **Final Checks:** The wall is gently cleaned again, removing any residual mortar smears and ensuring a refined finish.

### Warranty & Guarantees
- **Durability Assurance:** We back our repointing work with a workmanship warranty against cracking or separation caused by poor application.
- **Long-Term Preservation:** Combined with regular maintenance and inspections, repointing significantly extends the lifespan of your masonry.
- **Expert Guidance:** We offer advice on preventing moisture damage and recommend sealants or coatings if appropriate.
